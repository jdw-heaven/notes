**Repository**:a repository as a folder that contains related items, such as files, images, videos, or even other folders. A repository usually groups together items that belong to the same "project" or thing you're working on.

**README file**:a file with information about your project, written in Markdown.

**Branch**

**pull request**:Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

简单总结一下，你可以通过创建分支并 pull request 的方式来协作，在 pull request 中你可以看到对方的修改，并给出你的建议，最后你们可以决定是否合并到主分支。

| Term | Definition | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Download | To save a snapshot of a repository's files to your local computer. | You want to use or customize the content of the files, but you're not interested in applying version control. |
| Clone | To make a full copy of a repository's data, including all versions of every file and folder. | You want to work on a full copy of the repository on your local computer, using Git to track and manage your changes. You likely intend to sync these locally-made changes with the GitHub-hosted repository. For more information, see "[Cloning a repository](/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)." |
| Fork | To create a new repository on GitHub, linked to your personal account, that shares code and visibility settings with the original \("upstream"\) repository. | You want to use the original repository's data as a basis for your own project on GitHub. Or, you want to use the fork to propose changes to the original \("upstream"\) repository. After forking the repository, you still might want to clone the repository, so that you can work on the changes on your local computer. For more information, see "[Fork a repository](/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)." |
